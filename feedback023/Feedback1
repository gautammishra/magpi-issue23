At The MagPi, we love to hear your feedback - whether it is by email, facebook, twitter or face to face at one the many Raspberry Pi related events that are happening globally. Recently, our very own Colin Deady was at the Digimakers At-Bristol event and here are some of the feedback he received from people visiting The MagPi stand:
