From Colin's email:



From memory here is some feedback we received at the Digimakers At-Bristol event I covered - unfortunately these are all credited to “anon” as they were just comments in passing by people visiting the stand:


“It’s great to see Volume 2 of The MagPi in print. It’s looking even better than Volume 1.”
“Every month the magazine is released some of the kids at my school print and photocopy it so they each have their own copy.” (from a teacher).
“Keep up the good work, we look forward to every issue.” (said the same teacher).
“The MagPi magpie... it looks more like an eagle” (a bit random that one admittedly).
“Do you cover Minecraft?” (said teen 1)
“Do you cover Minecraft?” (said teen 2)
“Do you cover Minecraft? (said teen ..n) - this was a _very_ common question.


Oh and from our very own Meltwater entirely separately from the event on Twitter:
"I must not buy anything else for my Raspberry Pi x 1000"

PS: Yes, we cover Minecraft.
