I recently discovered the Raspberry Pi while looking for an FM transmitter I
could use at work after getting tired of listening to the same songs I've been
listening to for the last 35 years. I found an easy solution using the RasPi.
I also discovered your fantastic magazine, which brought back great memories
of typing in code from magazines into my Vic 20. I have always regretted
selling that computer, and the Pi is a great way to bring back those days.

I look forward to getting to know my little computer better through your
magazine. I have an exciting project in mind, and can't wait to get
experienced enough so I can implement and share it!

Thank you,
